Idee: Click on row in table displaying `gqa_train_demo.json`, then corresponding image is (`imageId`) is plotted. 


* 1) Interactive Datatable (filter rows by text) https://dash.plotly.com/datatable/interactivity
* 2) Return row infos (mainly column imageId) https://community.plotly.com/t/how-to-single-select-a-row-from-dash-datatable-and-create-a-line-graph-based-on-a-value-from-that-selected-row/56829


## Later
